# Flight-Delay-Cancellation-Analysis
I built an end-to-end aviation analytics dashboard using Power BI, designed on a Star Schema data model for optimized performance and clean reporting.

Designed and developed an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing 120M+ flight records across 10+ years, multiple airlines, hundreds of airports, and 6+ delay categories, enabling data-driven operational insights.

Implemented an optimized Star Schema data model with 1 fact table and multiple dimension tables (Time, Airline, Airport), improving report performance and ensuring accurate aggregations across millions of records.

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and tracked 15+ KPIs (total flights, delay rate, cancellation rate, delay minutes by cause) to identify major delay drivers such as carrier, weather, NAS, and late aircraft, highlighting key operational bottlenecks.
